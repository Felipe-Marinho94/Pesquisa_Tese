# **Research Thesis**
Codes implemented to obtain the results of my phd thesis.
I have dedicated myself to developing reduced models for Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNN), where I have used tensor decomposition techniques (Tucker and High Order Singular Values ​​Decompositions) in conjunction with sparse tensor regression to build a Deep Neural Network based in spectral GNN stackig blocks with Jump Knowledge.

I have been dedicated to developing approaches for sparsification and robustness of the Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM) model. The approaches proposed so far are as follows:
1. L1 regularization in the LSSVM primal problem and iterative numerical resolution via the Alternating Directions Multipliers Method (ADMM) algorithm;
2. Iterative pruning using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to solve the subproblems obtained from pruning;
3. Analysis of the simplex volumes generated by the support vectors.
